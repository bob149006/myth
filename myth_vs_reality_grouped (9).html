                    <div class="reality-text">Leaves and debris often clog gutters, but birds, rodents, and insects can also contribute by nesting or leaving droppings. Wind and storms may bring additional dirt and debris. Installing gutter guards helps prevent these clogs and reduces the need for frequent cleaning, even in areas without trees.</div>

                    <div class="reality-text">Some homeowners mistakenly think gutter guards are only helpful in areas with heavy rainfall or many trees, but they benefit any climate. Even in drier regions, gutter guards prevent dust, dirt, and debris accumulation in gutters, reducing the need for frequent cleaning.</div>

                    <div class="reality-text">Installing gutter guards initially costs more but saves in the long run by preventing clogs, reducing cleanings, and extending gutter lifespan. They also improve gutter efficiency, ensuring rainwater flows freely and reducing home water damage risks.</div>
